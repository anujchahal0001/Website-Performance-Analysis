# Website-Performance-Analysis
To Check proper performance of website, we have to work on Engaged Session, Average Engagement time per session, Engaged Session per user, Events Per Session, Engagement rate and so on.

Normalized Events per Session: Refers to the average number of user interactions (events) recorded during a single session, adjusted to account for variations in session length or user behavior. This metric provides a clearer picture of user engagement by normalizing data across different sessions, allowing for meaningful comparisons and insights into how effectively users are interacting with the site.

Normalized Engagement Rate: Measures the proportion of engaged sessions relative to the total sessions, adjusted for factors such as session duration and user actions. This metric highlights how effectively content or features retain user attention and encourage active participation, offering insights into overall site effectiveness.

User and Channel by Session: Examines the number of unique users engaging with a website, broken down by specific traffic channels (e.g., organic search, social media, direct traffic). This analysis helps identify which channels drive the most engaged sessions and which user demographics are most active, enabling targeted marketing strategies and resource allocation to enhance user acquisition and retention efforts.

Together, these metrics provide a comprehensive understanding of user behavior, engagement, and the effectiveness of different channels in driving meaningful interactions on a project.
